# Git Practice





From reading [this article on Clean Code](https://blog.cleancoder.com/) by Robert C. Martin,  

I learned a lot about how important it is to write code that is easy to read and maintain.  



The main idea is that code is read much more often than it is written.  

Good variable names, clear functions, and small classes reduce confusion and bugs.  

I found it interesting that the article compares code quality to professional craftsmanship,  

where even the smallest details show pride in your work.  



This really made me think about how, as developers, we’re not just “writing code to make it run”  

but also leaving something behind that others will work with in the future.

### Thoughts: 
This blog entry is interesting because it blends programming history, personal reflection, and software craftsmanship into one story. Uncle Bob revisits a game he first built in 1978 and reflects on how rewriting it decades later in Clojure with functional programming principles created a codebase that was easy to re-enter even after three years away. What stands out is how immutability, clear specs, and strong testing turned what could have been a daunting.
