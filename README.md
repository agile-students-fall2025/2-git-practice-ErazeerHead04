# Git Practice





From reading \[this article on Clean Code](https://blog.cleancoder.com/) by Robert C. Martin,  

I learned a lot about how important it is to write code that is easy to read and maintain.  



The main idea is that code is read much more often than it is written.  

Good variable names, clear functions, and small classes reduce confusion and bugs.  

I found it interesting that the article compares code quality to professional craftsmanship,  

where even the smallest details show pride in your work.  



This really made me think about how, as developers, we’re not just “writing code to make it run”  

but also leaving something behind that others will work with in the future.
